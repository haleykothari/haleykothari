Assignment: Halloween Anagram Game


First, you will create a tuple of 20 Halloween themed words, each between 5-12 letters.
Allow the user to play until they decide to quit. The user should get 3 guesses per round. 
If the user guesses correctly, they get a point. 
At the end of each round, the user total should be displayed. 
The user can type ‘Quit’ to stop playing.


Then, the program will pick one word randomly from this tuple and create all permutations in a list.
