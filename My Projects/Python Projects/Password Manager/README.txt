Assignment: Password Manager

A password manager application, which allows the user to add usernames and 
passwords associated with specific accounts to an encrypted dictionary for safekeeping. 


A user of your program should be able to: 
1. Add entries to the password manager by inputting the Name of Service, Username, and Password
2. View the unencrypted password for a particular service
3. Update the password of an existing entry


When a user needs to view the password, the code “decrypts” the stored version and print out the actual password. 

For Example:
A --> Z
B --> Y
C --> X 

Hence CAB --> XYZ
