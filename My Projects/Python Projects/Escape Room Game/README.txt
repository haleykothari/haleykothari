Assignment: Escape Room Game


The player starts at the entrance to the castle. They are then asked what room they would like to visit. 
When they visit that room, a brief description of the room and what they found there is printed, 
and then they are asked to choose another room to visit next. 
Each room includes a “mini-game” where the player must roll dice to receive different outcomes. 

1. You have at least 6 rooms
2. Not every room is reachable from every other room 
3. The game has several alternative endings

Because the world is a scary place, and nobody lives forever, there is a random number generator, 
that will give you a small probability of death at any step. 
Whenever the player enters a room, the code randomly checks if the player dies or not.
