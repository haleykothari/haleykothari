Assignment: Music Note Calculator


Source Files:
main.cpp

Uses pre-determined calculations of frequency and wavelength to calculate a specific note.
 - The wave length uses the speed of sound divided by the frequency of Note
 - the frequency of note is calculated by the reference frequency. 


Each note has a different sound therefore the code compiles for notes 
1. C0
2. C#0
3. D0
4. C4
5. D#7
6. C6

Emphasis writing different eqautions and including math in the code itself in C++ 
This was one of my earlier Projects done while I was still learning C++ and therefore syntax was crucial
