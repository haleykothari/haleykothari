Assignment or exercise number: MP 2: Pizza Pizza Pizza 

ERRORS 
In the Pizza class, I was having some trouble setting the different sizes, cheese, pepperoni, and veggies equal to each other in the equal method
- The error consisted with not being able to find the right symbol
- This was due to me not equalling the correct variables of the class

There was errors within the addPizza method in the PizzaOrder class
- This included syntax errors and overall logical errors on my part
- ChatGPT was used to help me figure it out, since I was struggling on that for a few hours

The Order was also not being printed correctly. This means that there was a bunch of random numbers in array instead of just showing me the contents of the array
- This was fixed, when I changed a few things in the toString from the Pizza class
